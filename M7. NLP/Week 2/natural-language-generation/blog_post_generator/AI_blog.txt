How do we use AI in everyday life?  AI can be used in many different ways. For example, we can use it to improve the quality of life for people in the developing world. AI can also help us make better decisions about how to spend our time and money, and it can improve our understanding of the world around us. In fact, AI is already being used to make decisions that affect the lives of millions of people around the globe, including the decisions we make every day about what to eat, where to live, what kind of car to buy, how much money to save for retirement, whether to get a driver's license or not, when to go to the doctor and when not to, who to vote for and who not. We are already seeing the impact of AI on our everyday lives, from the way we interact with our friends and family, to how we communicate with each other and with the people we work with. And we are only just beginning to understand how AI will impact our work and our lives.
